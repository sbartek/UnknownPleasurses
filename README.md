# Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures cover

This a R project to reproduce in R the cover of Joy Division's Unknown
Pleasures album. The cover was designed by Peter Saville and it
reproduces the image created by radio astronomer Harold Craft for his
PhD thesis. The image represents radio waves from pulsar CP 1919
recived at the Arecibo Observatory. Then it was reproduced in The
Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy.


Plan

* write R code that create similar picture
* create ggplot theme for pictures on black background
* make it a package out of it
